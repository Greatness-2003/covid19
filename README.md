# covid19

I designed and completed a project in which I acquired data about cases per 1000 people in the various states in Nigeria and analyzed the data and data from other sources using matplotlib and several other python libraries (sklearn, pandas, numpy, seaborn) to develop models to predict areas more prone to a higher number of cases of Covid-19.
